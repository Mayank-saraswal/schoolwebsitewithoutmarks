# Teacher Model Cleanup Summary

## Task: 6.1 Remove or deprecate teacher model

### Evaluation Results:

1. **No Teacher Model Found**: 
   - No `Teacher.js` file exists in `backend/models/` directory
   - No database model definitions for teachers found

2. **Admin Authentication Independence**:
   - Admin authentication uses hardcoded credentials from environment variables
   - JWT tokens are generated without any teacher model dependency
   - Admin login/logout functionality is completely independent

3. **Database Analysis**:
   - No teacher collections or schemas found
   - No foreign key references to teacher models in existing models
   - Student model and other models have no teacher dependencies

4. **Code References Cleaned Up**:
   - Updated comments in `backend/scripts/seedMarksConfig.js` to remove teacher references
   - Cleaned up comments in `backend/routes/adminRoutes.js`
   - Updated comments in `backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js`
   - Cleaned up comments in `backend/controllers/studentController.js`
   - Updated comments in `backend/controllers/configController.js`
   - Cleaned up comments in `backend/controllers/adminController.js`
   - Updated comments in `backend/controllers/adminAuthController.js`

### Verification:
- ✅ No teacher model imports or requires found
- ✅ No database model references to teachers
- ✅ Admin authentication works independently
- ✅ All backend files pass syntax validation
- ✅ No broken dependencies or references

### Conclusion:
The teacher model has already been effectively removed from the system. The admin authentication system operates independently without any teacher model dependencies. All remaining teacher references were in comments and console messages, which have been cleaned up.
