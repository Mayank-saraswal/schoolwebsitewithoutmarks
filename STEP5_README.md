3. **ClassFee Model** - Detailed fee structure by class and medium
4. **BusRoute Model** - Complete bus route management with capacity tracking
5. **Student Controller** - CRUD operations with teacher-specific access
6. **Config Controller** - API endpoints for subjects, fees, and bus routes
7. **Protected Routes** - Teacher authentication required for all operations

### Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

1. **StudentCreateForm** - Comprehensive form with real-time validation
2. **StudentList** - Advanced student management with search and filters
3. **Enhanced TeacherDashboard** - Tab-based navigation for student management
4. **Auto-fetch System** - Subjects and fees automatically loaded based on class
5. **Bilingual Support** - Hindi/English throughout the interface
6. **Mobile-responsive Design** - Optimized for all device sizes

### Key Features

- **Auto-generated SR Numbers** (SR2024001, SR2024002, etc.)
- **Automatic Fee Calculation** based on class and bus route
- **Subject Auto-assignment** from admin configuration
- **Bus Route Integration** with capacity management
- **Fee Status Tracking** (Paid, Partial, Unpaid)
- **Search & Filter** functionality for student management
- **Teacher-specific Access** - teachers limited to their assigned class

## API Endpoints

```
# Student Management
POST   /api/students/create              # Create new student
GET    /api/students/my-students         # Get teacher's students
GET    /api/students/:id                 # Get student details
PUT    /api/students/:id                 # Update student
GET    /api/students/next-sr-number      # Generate next SR number

# Configuration
GET    /api/config/subjects/:class       # Get subjects for class
GET    /api/config/fees/:class           # Get fee structure
GET    /api/config/bus-fee/:route        # Get bus route fee
GET    /api/config/bus-routes            # Get all bus routes
GET    /api/config/student-form/:class   # Complete form config
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Backend**: Server is configured and running
2. **Frontend**: Student management integrated into teacher dashboard  
3. **Database**: Models created and ready for data
4. **Authentication**: Teacher JWT protection implemented

## Usage Flow

1. Login as teacher (existing Step 4 accounts)
2. Navigate to teacher dashboard
3. Use "Create Student" or "My Students" tabs
4. Form auto-loads subjects and fees based on class selection
5. Bus routes add additional fees automatically
6. View and manage all created students

## Sample Data Needed

To test the system, add sample data to MongoDB collections:
- `subjects` - Class-wise subject mappings
- `classfees` - Fee structures by class and medium  
- `busroutes` - Bus routes with fees and capacity

## Technical Highlights

- **Comprehensive Validation** - Frontend and backend validation
- **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages in both languages
- **Performance Optimized** - Pagination, search, and filtering
- **Security Focused** - JWT authentication and role-based access
- **Production Ready** - Complete error handling and edge cases covered
