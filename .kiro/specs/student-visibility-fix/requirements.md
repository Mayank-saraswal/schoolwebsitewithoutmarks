# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The student visibility issue in the Teacher and Admin Dashboards needs to be comprehensively fixed. Currently, students created by teachers are saved successfully in the database but do not appear in the frontend components (Teacher > My Students or Admin > Student Management). The issue involves missing medium selection options, incorrect filtering by academicYear and medium, and inconsistent data flow between frontend and backend components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to see all students I have created in the "My Students" section, so that I can manage and track my students effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher logs into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their medium and academic year in the header
2. WHEN a teacher navigates to "My Students" THEN the system SHALL fetch and display only students created by that teacher
3. WHEN filtering students THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the teacher's medium and current academic year as filters
4. WHEN no students are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no students exist for the current filters
5. IF the teacher's medium is not set THEN the system SHALL display an error message prompting to contact administrator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see all students in the Student Management section with proper filtering options, so that I can oversee all student data across different mediums and academic years.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide medium and academic year selection options
2. WHEN an admin selects a medium and year THEN the system SHALL fetch and display students matching those criteria
3. WHEN no medium or year is selected THEN the system SHALL prompt the admin to make selections before displaying student data
4. WHEN student data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display accurate statistics including total students, fee status counts, and bus service counts
5. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the student list and statistics accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the student creation process to automatically use my medium and academic year, so that created students appear in my student list without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher creates a new student THEN the system SHALL automatically set the medium from the teacher's profile
2. WHEN a teacher creates a new student THEN the system SHALL automatically set the academic year to the current year
3. WHEN student creation is successful THEN the system SHALL immediately refresh the "My Students" list to show the new student
4. WHEN student data is saved THEN the system SHALL ensure medium and academicYear fields are properly populated in the database
5. IF teacher medium is not available THEN the system SHALL prevent student creation and display an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend API to properly filter students by medium and academic year, so that frontend components receive accurate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the getMyStudents API is called THEN the system SHALL filter students by the teacher's medium and academic year
2. WHEN the admin students API is called THEN the system SHALL filter students by the provided medium and academic year parameters
3. WHEN filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL log the filter criteria for debugging purposes
4. WHEN no students match the criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with appropriate statistics
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper indexing for medium and academicYear fields

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling throughout the student visibility flow, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request parameters and response data
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN students are filtered THEN the system SHALL log the applied filter criteria and result counts
4. WHEN context initialization occurs THEN the system SHALL log the teacher/admin context setup
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the frontend

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want automated tests to validate the student visibility functionality, so that regressions can be prevented in future releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL validate teacher login and context initialization
2. WHEN student creation is tested THEN the system SHALL verify proper medium and academic year assignment
3. WHEN student listing is tested THEN the system SHALL confirm correct filtering and data retrieval
4. WHEN admin functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL validate proper medium/year selection and filtering
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up all test data to prevent database pollution
