  description: String,              // Required, max 1000 characters
  year: Number,                     // Required, 2020-2030
  medium: String,                   // Required, "Hindi" or "English"
  visibility: String,               // Required, "public" or "dashboard"
  postedOn: Date,                   // Auto-generated timestamp
  createdBy: ObjectId,              // Reference to admin/teacher
  createdByName: String,            // Admin name for display
  isActive: Boolean,                // Soft delete flag
  createdAt: Date,                  // Auto-generated
